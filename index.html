        <h1 class="heading">What Is Git?</h1>
        <p class="para">Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It helps in coordinating
            work amongst several people in a project and tracks progress over time. Unlike the centralized version
            control system, Git branches can be easily merged. A new branch
            is created every time a developer wants to start working on something. This ensures that the master branch
            always has a production-quality code.</p>
        <p class="para">Git is a distributed version control system, so here, every developer gets their local
            repository with full commit history.
            The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform
            difference between commits.</p>
        <p class="para">Now that we know more about Git let us explore GitHub.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">What Is GitHub?</h1>
        <p class="para">GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface (GUI).
            It helps
            every team member work together on a project from anywhere, making it easy to collaborate. </p>
        <p class="para">GitHub is one place where project managers and developers coordinate, track, and update their
            work, so projects stay transparent and on schedule. The packages can be published privately, within the
            team, or publicly for the open-source community. Downloading packages from GitHub enables them to be used
            and reused. GitHub helps all team members stay on the same page and stay organized. Moderation tools, like
            issue and pull request locking, helps the team focus on the code.</p>
        <p class="para">Next in this how Git works tutorial, let's look at the several commands used in Git.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Different Commands in Git</h1>
        <p class="para">So far, in the "How Git Works" tutorial you read all about Git and GitHub. Next comes Git
