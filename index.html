        <p class="para">Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It helps in coordinating
            work amongst several people in a project and tracks progress over time. Unlike the centralized version
            control system, Git branches can be easily merged. A new branch
            is created every time a developer wants to start working on something. This ensures that the master branch
            always has a production-quality code.</p>
        <p class="para">Git is a distributed version control system, so here, every developer gets their local
            repository with full commit history.
            The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform
            diffs between commits.</p>
