        <h1 class="heading">What Is Git?</h1>
        <p class="para">Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It helps in coordinating
            work amongst several people in a project and tracks progress over time. Unlike the centralized version
            control system, Git branches can be easily merged. A new branch
            is created every time a developer wants to start working on something. This ensures that the master branch
            always has a production-quality code.</p>
        <p class="para">Git is a distributed version control system, so here, every developer gets their local
            repository with full commit history.
            The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform
            difference between commits.</p>
        <p class="para">Now that we know more about Git let us explore GitHub.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">What Is GitHub?</h1>
        <p class="para">GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface (GUI).
            It helps
            every team member work together on a project from anywhere, making it easy to collaborate. </p>
        <p class="para">GitHub is one place where project managers and developers coordinate, track, and update their
            work, so projects stay transparent and on schedule. The packages can be published privately, within the
            team, or publicly for the open-source community. Downloading packages from GitHub enables them to be used
            and reused. GitHub helps all team members stay on the same page and stay organized. Moderation tools, like
            issue and pull request locking, helps the team focus on the code.</p>
        <p class="para">Next in this how Git works tutorial, let's look at the several commands used in Git.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Different Commands in Git</h1>
        <p class="para">So far, in the "How Git Works" tutorial you read all about Git and GitHub. Next comes Git
            commands. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Git config</li>
            <li>Git init</li>
            <li>Git add</li>
            <li>Git diff</li>
            <li>Git commit</li>
            <li>Git reset</li>
            <li>Git status</li>
            <li>Git merge</li>
            <li>Git push</li>
            <li>Git pull</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para">Next in this tutorial, we will go over the Git commands in detail. </p>

        <h1 class="heading">Git Push Command</h1>
        <p class="para">The Git push command is used to push the local repository content to a remote repository. After
            a local repository has been modified, a push is executed to share the modifications with remote team
            members. Pushing is the way commits are transferred from the local repository to the remote repository.</p>

        <p class="para">Let us take a look at a Git push command demo.</p>
        <h1 class="heading">Demo of Git Push Command</h1>
        <p class="para">Now letâ€™s start with opening Git Bash and configuring it with a
            username and email ID. To configure, we use the following commands:</p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>git config --global user.name "Shumaim11"</code>
            <code>git config --global user.email "shumaimsaleem@gmail.com"</code>
            <code>git config --list</code>
        </div>

             alt="Git Push Command Demo">
        <p class="para">Then, let's check the current working directory:</p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>pwd</code>
        </div>
        <img class="center mt-40" width="547" height="63" src="assets/images/pwd.png" alt="pwd command">
        <p class="para">To create a repository in the working directory, use the following commands:
        </p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>mkdir git_demo</code>
            <code>cd git_demo</code>
            <code>pwd</code>
        </div>
        <img class="center mt-40" width="586" height="210" src="assets/images/git_demo.png" alt="pwd-demo command">
        <p class="para">The directory "Git_demo" will be empty for now.</p>
        <p class="para">Let's create a folder for the repository.</p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>mkdir FirstRepo</code>
            <code>cd FirstRepo</code>
            <code>pwd</code>
        </div>
        <img class="center mt-40" width="677" height="246" src="assets/images/mkdir_firstrepo.png"
             alt="mkdir FirstRepo">
        <p class="para">The folder "FirstRepo" is empty. We will now initialize a repository to our folder.</p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>git init</code>
        </div>
        <img class="center mt-40" width="756" height="122" src="assets/images/Initialized%20git.png"
             alt="git init command">

        <p class="para">Something called the "master" appears on the screen. Whenever a Git repository is created for
            the first time, it creates a branch, and the name of the branch is master. Navigate to the folder; you can
            find a hidden ".git" folder. </p>
        <p class="para">If you check the folder, you can see several directories and configurations. Make sure you don't
            make any changes to any of the directories.</p>

        <p class="para">This is created when a repository is initialized. </p>
        <p class="para">Moving further, let's make some commits. For that, we will create two files and commit them
            one by one.</p>
        <p class="para">For the first file, the commands are as follows:</p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>touch alpha.txt</code>
            <code>notepad alpha.txt</code>

        <p class="para">A notepad opens on the screen. Type anything inside it, save it and close it.</p>

             alt="Creating File using touch command, writing in it and saving it.">

        <p class="para">Next, let's check the status of the file that was created.
        </p>
        <div class="ml-20 flex flex-col">
            <code>git status</code>
        </div>
        <p class="para">This shows that there isn't a file committed yet, and there are untracked files. The untracked
            files can be seen in red.</p>
